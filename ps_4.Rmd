```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE)

# i started by copying the URL off of the github repository by clicking 'Clone or Download' and pasting it into RStudio by creating a New Project and opening Version Control

# the chunk above ensures that there are no undesirable pieces of code, warnings, errors, and messages in the html output

# it is important to load all of the packages so that the code actually works

x <- read_csv("ps_4_elections-poll-nc09-3.csv")

# i loaded the dataset by using the 'read_csv()' function and assigned it to variable 'x' so that i can easily spell it out whenever i need to without typing in its long name

z <- x %>% filter(response == "Rep") %>% nrow() 
y <- x %>% filter(response == "Und") %>% nrow()

# when answering question 2 in Question 1 I assigned the respondent groups to z and y in roder to easily calculate their difference

a <- x %>% filter(response == "Rep") %>% slice(1) %>% pull(timestamp)
b <- x %>% filter(response == "Dem") %>% slice(1) %>% pull(timestamp)

# when answering question 5 in Question 1 I assigned the two time stamps to a and b in roder to easily calculate the time difference and then put the equation inside the'round()' function to round the value to the nearest minute.        

# when inserting r code into the answers below, i made sure to enclose them in backticks and start with 'r' and then piping in the code

# it is important to make sure that the answers are single numbers and not pieces of data, so that the output can actually show an answer. This is why i use a lot of 'nrow()' here, to actually count the data that i want

```
##Question 1

There were `r x %>% filter(response == "Dem") %>% nrow()` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were `r z-y` more respondents who voted the Republican candidate than who were undecided.

There are two gender variables (gender and gender_combined). There are `r x %>% filter(gender!= gender_combined) %>% nrow()` individuals for whom these variables have different values.

There are `r x %>% filter(race_eth == "White", race_eth!=file_race_black) %>% nrow()` respondents listed as “White” under race_eth who are not listed as “White” under file_race_black.

The first response of Rep came `r round(b-a)` minutes (rounded to the nearest minute) before the first response of Dem.

##Question 2 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

table <- x %>% 
  
  # i assigned the dataset x to table when working on creating a table using values from the dataset
  
  select(response, race_eth, final_weight) %>% 
  
 # i selected the variables that I would need for this table, since i am not working with everything that the dataset includes
  
  filter(race_eth != "[DO NOT READ] Don't know/Refused") %>% 
  
  # i made sure to exclude results that do not provide any information
  
  mutate(race_eth = fct_relevel(race_eth, "White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other")) %>% 
  
  # i had to ensure the correct ordering. in this step, it is important to spell everything out precisely because the code wont work if there is a slightest spelling mistake
  
   group_by(response, race_eth) %>% 
  
  # these are the variables that we want to look at the table
  
  summarize(total = sum(final_weight)) %>% 
  
  # i want to have a total amount, so i use sum(final_weight) to summarize that number
  
  spread(key =  response, value = total, fill = 0) %>% 
  
  # it is important to assign the variables to correct roles
  
  mutate(total = Dem + Rep + Und + `3`) %>% 
  mutate(Dem = Dem / total) %>% 
  mutate(Rep = Rep / total) %>% 
  mutate(Und = Und / total) %>% 
  select(-total, -`3`)

# since we are looking at percentages, we first establish the total by summing all response options and mutate them into their values divided by total

  gt(table) %>% 
    
    # remember to load gt, and then use gt to make adjustments to the table
    
    tab_header(
      title = "Polling Results by Race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District") %>% 
    # this function lets me create a title for my table
    
    cols_label(
      race_eth = "",
      Dem = "DEM.",
      Rep = "REP.",
      Und = "UND."
      ) %>%
    
    # here, i am assigning column names to my variables
    
    tab_source_note(source_note = "New York Times Upshot/Siena College 2018 live polls") %>% 
    
  # this creates a caption for the table
    
    fmt_percent(columns = vars(Dem, Rep, Und),
                decimals = 0) %>% 
    
    # we want to have accurate percentages of our values
    
    na_if(0) %>%
fmt_missing(columns = vars(Und), rows = 4) 
  
  # we want to have a dash instead of a '0%' value, so the last two code lines ensure that we get that in our table
  
```


##Question 3


```{r graph, echo = FALSE}

# after starting each separate r code chunk, it is important to include 'echo = FALSE inside {r} to make sure the code does not appear in the output

library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)

x %>%
  
  # i start by saying that i am working with x and then piping in the code
  
  select(educ, final_weight) %>% 
  
  # i select the variables i want to work with in this graph
  
  filter(educ != "[DO NOT READ] Refused") %>%
  
  # i make sure to exclude responses that do not provide information 
  
  mutate(educ = fct_relevel(educ, "Grade school", "High school", "Some college or trade school", "Bachelors' degree", "Graduate or Professional Degree")) %>% 
  
  # i make sure that the y values are standing in correct ordering 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = final_weight)) +
  
  # i assign the variables to x and y axis
  
  geom_violin() +
  
  # this is what i want my graph shape to be
  
  geom_jitter(width = .2, size = 1.0, alpha = .5) +
  
  # i assign the most accurate values to the graph 
  
  coord_flip() +
  
  # i flip my coordinates 
  
  labs(title = 'More Educated Matter Less in North Carolina 9th',
       subtitle = 'Poll gives more weight to people who are less likely to participate in polls',
       caption = 'New York Times Upshot/Siena College 2018 live polls') +
  
  # i assign the labels, such as title, subtitle, and caption, to the graph
  
  ylab("Weight Given to Respondent in Calculating Poll Results") +
  xlab(NULL)

# i assign a y axis label and, since the x axis do not have one, i say that it's NULL

```

##Question 4 


```{r four, echo = FALSE}

x %>% 
  select(ager, response) %>%
  
  # i select variables i want to observe in my individual graph
  
  filter(ager != "[DO NOT READ] Refused") %>%
  
  # i only want to look at responses that provide useful information for me to gather data from
  
  filter(response != "3") %>%
  
  # i only want to look at Rep, Dem, and Und, so i exclude third parties from my graph
  
  mutate(ager = fct_relevel(ager, "18 to 34", "35 to 49", "50 to 64", "65 and older")) %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "Und", "Rep", "Dem")) %>%
  
  # i order the columns in a way i want them portrayed on the graph
  
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = ager, fill = response)) +
  
  # i know that i want to use a bar chart and i use fill, so that different responses provide different color fills
  
  scale_fill_manual("legend", values = c("Rep" = "red", "Dem" = "blue", "Und" = "green")) +
  
  # i assign appropriate colors (blue for Dem, red for Rep, and green (as another basic color that is different from red and blue) for Undecided)
  
  labs(title = 'Polling Results Depending on Age in North Carolina 9th Congressional District',
       subtitle = 'Poll shows political preferences of four age groups',
       caption = 'New York Times Upshot/Siena College 2018 live polls') +
  
  # i assign labels to my graph to give more information about what it portrays
  
  ylab("Number of Respondents") +
  xlab("Age") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Party"))

# for the most user-friendly graph, i assign labels for my x and y axis and assign a new name to my legend, so that instead of saying 'legend' it actually says 'Party', the information the color fill gives
